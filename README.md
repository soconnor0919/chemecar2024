# 2024 Bucknell Chem-E-Car Regional Control System Code

## DISCLAIMER
**This repository has been archived in favor of [control-system-na24](https://github.com/soconnor0919/control-system-na24) as the Arduino VSCode extension has been discontinued. We have moved development over to the PlatformIO framework.**

## Description
This repository contains the code for the 2024 Bucknell Chem-E-Car Control System. The Chem-E-Car is a chemical-powered car that is designed to compete in the annual AIChE Chem-E-Car competition. The competition involves designing and building a car that is powered and stopped by a chemical reaction and can stop at a predetermined distance.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Control System Code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/soconnor0919/control-system-re24.git`
2. Install the Arduino extension in Visual Studio Code
3. Open the project in VSCode, and configure your microcontroller
4. Connect your Arduino board to your computer.
5. Upload the code to your Arduino board.

## Usage
The `chemecar2024.ino` file contains the main code for the Control System. It includes the necessary functions and logic to control the car's movements and perform the required tasks. You can modify the code to customize the behavior of the car or add new features.
